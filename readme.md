Loot & Waifus website code repository.

The code is a mess, I'm just open sourcing it in case people want to contribute or get some of the code we're using for specific functionalities:

- Event timeline
- Daily boss
- Team builder
- Team randomizer

Some stuff will not work just by using this theme on your website tho, we use some plugins (love and hate WordPress, but c'est la vie).

These are the plugins we currently use:

- [Advanced iFrame](https://wordpress.org/plugins/advanced-iframe/) (embedding bilibili videos)
- [Insert Pages](https://wordpress.org/plugins/insert-pages/) (show character portraits with rarity based backgrounds in other guides)

The rest of the plugins are the usual ones for SEO and security, nothing mandatory.

Any questions you might have regarding the code, how it works or how to contribute, feel free to add me in Discord (sefhi).
