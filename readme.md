Loot & Waifus website code repository.

The code is a mess, I'm just open sourcing it in case people want to contribute or get some of the code we're using for specific functionalities:

- event timeline
- daily special interception
- team builder

Some stuff will not work just by using this theme on your website tho, we use some plugins (love and hate WordPress, but c'est la vie).

These are the plugins we currently use:

Any questions you might have regarding the code, how it works or how to contribute, feel free to add me in Discord (sefhi).
